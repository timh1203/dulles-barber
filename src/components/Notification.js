    <P1>
      <Span1>Closed Temporarily</Span1> <br />
      Following today's order from Governor Northam to delay opening until May 29th, we will remain closed and not taking any appointments at this time.
      Loudoun County has been mandated to remain in Phase 0 due to Northern Virginia's reported cases of about 14,000.
      The owners are using their best judgment and awaiting further developing policies.
      We thank you for your continued patience and hope you can understand all the risks we face when re-opening.
      As always, we greatly appreciate your heartfelt support for our barbers and Dulles Barber! <br />
