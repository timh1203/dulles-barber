      Due to the current situation, we have closed our Ashburn and Sterling locations until further notice. <br />
      At this time, we are not doing house calls or taking appointments. We are sorry for this inconvenience. <br />
      Also, we greatly appreciate the influx of support from our customers but not accepting donations/gift cards purchases. <br />
      We are managing and aware of the government programs. We are looking brightly to the future and for now, <br />
      we are following mandated procedures until June. Please stay safe and we will make new updates right here on our website first. <br />
      We thank you for your understanding in the interest of your health and the general public. <br />
